👋 Hi, I’m @Agraja2731  
👀 I’m interested in all things data-related, from analysis and visualization to storytelling through numbers! I also have a growing passion for technology, psychology, and human behavior analysis.  
🌱 I’m currently learning Python, data analysis, and visualization tools like Matplotlib and Pandas. I'm also exploring the world of machine learning step by step.  
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginner-friendly data analysis projects, Python-based applications, or even small machine learning projects. If you have a cool idea or need help with data crunching, I’d love to contribute!  
📫 How to reach me: Feel free to message me on GitHub or connect with me on https://www.linkedin.com/in/agraja-kawale-9b182326a/ . I’m always up for a chat about tech, data, or life!  
😄 Pronouns: She/Her  
⚡ Fun fact: Besides crunching numbers, I love solving puzzles and riddles. I also enjoy binge-watching true crime documentaries and attempting to solve the cases myself before the reveal!
